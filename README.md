# Analysis
A compiler has:

| Name | Description | Example |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Tokens | The compiler creates a list of tokens by analyzing all the words written in the code against the reserved words of the language grammar (EBNF) | <code>if</code> <code>else</code> <code>while</code> |
| Output Errors | The compiler has a list of errors that are displayed during or after the end of the compilation and are made up of errors found in any of the three compilation analyzes | Unexpected Token  |
| Lexical Analysis | The first phase of compiler analysis, here, the compiler identifies and lists tokens and identifies lexical errors | [Reference](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compiler_design/compiler_design_lexical_analysis.htm#:~:text=Lexical%20analysis%20is%20the%20first,comments%20in%20the%20source%20code.) |
| Syntactic Analysis | The second phase of compiler analysis, here, the compiler identifies whether tokens are following the rules of language grammar | [Reference](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compiler_design/compiler_design_syntax_analysis.htm) |
| Semantic Analysis | The third and final analysis phase, here, the compiler checks whether the value of the variable tokens (```numbers```, ```string```, ```boolean```, etc.) are inserted in logically correct operations | [Reference](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compiler_design/compiler_design_semantic_analysis.htm) |
